[00:44.41] 
[00:36.92] I wouldn't mind
[00:42.40] I heard that falling fast is so divine
[00:49.63] Are these songs just telling plain old lies?
[01:11.63] 
[00:56.15] 'Cause that's everything I know about love (hmm-hmm)
[01:03.70] Everything I know about love (hmm-hmm)

[01:16.02] Every time I try, it's all too much
[01:24.65] That's everything I know about love
[01:42.15] 
[01:33.02] Captivating angel eyes
[01:39.66] Stomach sick with butterflies (ha-ah)

[01:54.19] That this isn't fantasy?
[02:06.19] 
[02:01.35] 'Cause I wouldn't mind
[02:07.18] I heard that falling fast is so divine

[02:40.69] Every time I try, it's all too much (ooh)
[02:49.44] That's everything I know about love (hmm-hmm)
[02:53.11] (Everything I know) (hmm-hmm)
[03:00.27] (Everything I know)
[03:09.77]
