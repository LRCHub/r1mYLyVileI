So enchanting in every way
It's everlasting every day
Sweet obsession, rose bouquets
Oh, it's heaven or so they say
I wouldn't mind
I heard that falling fast is
so divine
Are these songs
just telling plain old lies?
Cause that's everything
I know about love
Everything I know about love
I don't know that much at all
I trip, I fall
Every time I try it's all
too much
That's everything
I know about love
Captivating angel eyes
Stomach sick with butterflies
When will someone prove to me
That this isn't fantasy
Cause I wouldn't mind
I heard that falling fast is
so divine
Are these songs
just telling plain old lies?
Cause that's everything
I know about love
(Everything I know)
That's everything
I know about love
(Everything I know)
Oh, I don't know
that much at all
I trip, I fall
Every time I try it's all
too much
That's everything
I know about love
(Everything I know)
(Everything I know)
Oh,
I don't know that much at all
I trip, I fall
Every time I try it's all
too much
That's everything
I know about love
